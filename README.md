EV Vehicle/Charging Demand Prediction

## Problem Statement
Using the electric vehicle dataset (which includes information on EV populations, vehicle types, and possibly historical charging usage), create a model to forecast future EV adoption. For example, predict the number of electric vehicles in upcoming years based on the trends in the data.

## Goal
Build a regression model that forecasts future EV adoption demand based on historical trends in EV growth, types of vehicles, and regional data.

## Dataset
This dataset shows the number of vehicles that were registered by Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) each month. The data is separated by county for passenger vehicles and trucks.
