# EV Vehicle Charge Demand

## Overview
This project forecasts electric vehicle (EV) adoption and charging demand using historical registration data and machine learning techniques.

## Problem Statement
Build a regression model to predict future EV adoption and charging demand based on historical data, vehicle types, and county-level information.

## Dataset
Source: [Kaggle - Electric Vehicle Population Size 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahirmaharajj/electric-vehicle-population-size-2024/data)

The dataset contains monthly EV registrations by county, including passenger vehicles and trucks.

## Columns
- Date
- County
- State
- Electric Vehicle (EV) Total
- Percent Electric Vehicles
- Vehicle Type
- Fuel Type
- Make
- Model
- Model Year

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project folder as `EV_dataset.csv`.
3. Open `EV_Adoption.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code and run the cells to train and evaluate the model.
